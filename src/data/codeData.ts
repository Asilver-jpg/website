Starting with a raw Google Drive of 80+ folders and a minimal script, I built a tool to convert .docx files to HTML and map the file structure for use in the simulation. I then designed a 1960s-inspired terminal UI, implemented input logic based on the narrative, and produced a concluding video. The prototype was approved without notes and handed directly to backend. Built with TypeScript, React, and Redux. This will not work in mobile and is designed to be used while in fullscreen.`,
